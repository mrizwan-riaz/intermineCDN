This folder contains the generated BlueGenes CSS for use during development of
BlueGenes Tools, so that their styling during development is consistent with
how they'll look when deployed within BlueGenes. The files will be updated
in-place, replacing the old ones, but this should happen very infrequently as
changes to global CSS selectors are rare.
